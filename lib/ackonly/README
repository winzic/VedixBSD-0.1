All libraries are built for ack and for gcc separately. gmake is used as
make, and gcc is used for compiling. This takes up a lot more memory
than minix make and ack. To compile the libraries for ack only, e.g.
for systems with less memory than required for gcc and gmake, follow
these steps:

1. chmem /usr/gnu/bin/gmake to 250 kB
2. Copy  Makefile.ack.inc in this directory to ../Makefile.inc
2. Copy  Makefile-ack to ../Makefile.

Then run gmake as normal.
